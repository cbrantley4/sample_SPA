  <h1>When I am not working, I like to:</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Run
      <p>I enjoy running in Forest Park but do not always make it out there. When I do run, I like to go for about 3 miles.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Go to the gym
      <p>I recently joined a gym called D1 that I am really enjoying. There are bootcamp-style exercise classes that allow me to have a full-body workout. </p>
    </li>
    <li>Read
      <p>If it weren't for the library's Overdrive program, I don't think I would have made it through the pandemic. I love escaping into the story of a good book, especially historical fictions. </p>
